# SocketProgramming-Application
I have created a Server which is a serverSocket which accepts many clients.
For message i have used datagramSockets.
And for UI i have used swings.
Features of this application
1.	The user must be Registered to the chat Server and that name must be unique.
2.	Once the user is registered Chat server will show the list of users who are online.
3.	And then when you select a user if that user is busy it will show busy message.
4.	If the user is not found it will show error message.
5.	Or else the chat happens.
6.	Once they done talking the user can logoff the chat.
7.	Once they are logged off they are free to chat with other user.
8.	Once users leave the Chat Server there name can be used by new users.
9.	And once the user logoff from the chat both of them get a message that “you have been logged off”.
